# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Predicting the fare of the flight using machine learning
### Description

Guessing the flight prices can be very hard sometimes, today we might see a price but when we check out the same flight the price might be different. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Here we will be provided with different prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.

### Problem Statemtent

We will use these flight records to determine flight prices based on the different parameters.
